.LOG
8:25 AM 9/10/2015

This log has been created to record data and events that occur 
in our Quadcopter team.

So far, our goal for this semester is to have the quadcopter hover
stably. 

We will mainly use PID algorithms to achieve this.

You are welcome to record any data or add comments to this log at 
anytime.

Sunday Meeting (2 - 4:15 PM)

1) Resume/Career-Fair/Interview Talk
	* Include your GPA on your resume no matter what
	* Show your skills through your project/work experience
2) Live Coding
	* C/C++
	* Learned how to fit everything into one for loop
	* Pre/Post increment
3) PID algorithms
	* Went through code to understand how PID is being used
	* PIDs have 2 inputs: current val and setpoint, a feedback loop,
 	  and an output that outputs the fixed value every cycle
	* 4 PIDs: altitude, pitch, roll, yaw
	* altitude will be set by the controller
	* pitch, roll, yaw will be set by us
