.LOG
8:25 AM 9/10/2015

This log has been created to record data and events that occur 
in our Quadcopter team.

So far, our goal for this semester is to have the quadcopter hover
stably. 

We will mainly use PID algorithms to achieve this.

You are welcome to record any data or add comments to this log at 
anytime.

Sunday Meeting (2 - 4:15 PM)

1) Resume/Career-Fair/Interview Talk
	* Include your GPA on your resume no matter what
	* Show your skills through your project/work experience
2) Live Coding
	* C/C++
	* Learned how to fit everything into one for loop
	* Pre/Post increment
3) PID algorithms
	* Went through code to understand how PID is being used
	* PIDs have 2 inputs: current val and setpoint, a feedback loop,
 	  and an output that outputs the fixed value every cycle
	* 4 PIDs: altitude, pitch, roll, yaw
	* altitude will be set by the controller
	* pitch, roll, yaw will be set by us

Sunday Meeting (11 - )

1) Live Coding
	* WAP: Given two arrays of numbers >= 0, find differences.
		Ex) arr1: 1,3,7,0,5;
		    arr2: 1,2,4,7,9,3;
		    diff: 2,4,9,3
2) GitHub
	* Basic steps: make changes, add changes, commit, push
	* You can download github and then Git Shell, or do it through Cygwin.
	* git init: makes a GitHub directory
	* git remote add <name> <URL>: git remote add firmware https://github.com/ISUCTQuadcopterTeam/QuadCSource
	* git remote -v
	* git pull <name> master: git pull firmware master
	* make a file, ex: text.txt
	* git add <file-name>: git add text.txt
	* git commit -m "message": git commit -m "test"
	* git push <name>: git push text.txt
	* Remove file from your local directory: rm <file-name>: rm text.txt
	* Commit the changes: git commit -m "message"
	* Push the changes: git push <name>: git push firmware
